# Introduction

## 1. Definition of combustion
> ### 1.1. combustion
> A rapid exothermic osidation process which delivers hot products.

> ### 1.2. Frame
> A self-sustaining propagation of a localized combustion zone. From atomic scale perspective, a radiating plasma in which the high temperature strips some of the electrons from their nuclei.

## 2. Why combustion is important?
Combustion provide us a large fraction of energy for transportation, electricity, residential heating, commercial energy needs, and military applications.

## 3. Impacts of combustion
### 3.1. Positive impacts
- Transportation and electricity

### 3.2. Negative impacts
- Atmospheric pollution
    - Particulate pollutants: smoke, soot, fly ash, dust
    - Gaseout pollutants: SOx, NOx
- Global warming and climate change

## 4. Main Objective of combustion science and technology
1. Design safe and reliable combustion system
2. Maximize thermal efficiency and minimize fuel consumption
3. Minimize pollutant emissions and climate change/impact

## 5. Type of combustion depending on mixing of fuel and oxidizer
1. Premixed combustion
    1. Deflagnation
    2. Detonation
2. Diffusion combustion



## 6. Governing equations overview

- Continuity equation
- Species equation
- Momentum equation
- Energy equation
